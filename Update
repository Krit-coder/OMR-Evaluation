- Studied OpenCv
- Learned to read, resize, show, and stack images in single window
- Learned to read and draw contours
- Had problem in getting a sample omr sheet with less number of question for trials
- Had wrong reading
- Tried making omr in word but it was not good and was giving wrong results
- To be continued.

17th April:
- Designed a OMR for the project
- Identified the rectangles and form them the needed ones.
- Extracted the corner points.
- Reordered the corner points.
- Extracted or Got the Warp Image(Only Bubble portion of img) of the Bubble points.
- To be continued.

18th April:

- We made a function to extract each bubble and store it in an array.
- There was error as there was non uniformity in the OMR sheet.
